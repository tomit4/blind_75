- Every three days go back and try and solve the problems from two days ago and
  try to solve them blind.
- Rinse and repeat until satisfied with your hit rate.

**TODO:**

- [ ] Create a list as NeetCode advises, write down simple 1 sentence notes on
      each solution that you can memorize. You'll never be able to memorize the
      solutions, but you <em>can</em> memorize hints!!
